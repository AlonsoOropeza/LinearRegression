# Predicting features of human anatomy using linear regression
## Abstract
Have you ever wonder if the stature of a person determines the lenght of their feet and hands? For Lord of the Rings fans, what about hobbits, they are smaller than humans, nevertheless they have large feet. Is there any relation between these variables or is it mere coincidence? Thankfully, using linear regression, we can predict a parameter of interest based on its dependance of other features to finally answer if its true our hypothesis. 
## Introduction
As we implied in the abstract, our objective is to determine if there is any relation between the stature of a human and the lenght of their feet and hands.
We will be using linear regression, which is a machine learning algorithm thats tries to fit data into a linear model. But for those of you who just read that line and didn't understand what the heck I am talking about, let me rephrase it. Do you remember your highschool math clases, when you saw the equation of a line? 
The famous y = mx + b
Where y is the output, m is the slope of the line, x is the input and b is the intercept? Well this is kind of the same, but with minor modifications.
Now we could have multiple features that means multiple slopes and x's, b is now going to be the bias (how true is our data) and the slope determines how disperse is our data.
